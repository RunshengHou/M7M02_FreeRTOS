## How to use these files?

- The files in the [Guest](/Guest/) folder should be merged into the directory of the same name in [M7M02_Ammonite](https://github.com/EDI-Systems/M7M02_Ammonite)
- The specific project folders need to be placed under the `/Project` path in [M7M02_Ammonite](https://github.com/EDI-Systems/M7M02_Ammonite)

If you have completed both of the above, you can easily evaluate FreeRTOS performance of different OS functions on `RME/RVM`.
